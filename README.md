# WorkshopUploader
The **Workshop Uploader** is a custom plugin created to facilitate adding steam workshop support to **Unreal Engine 4 and 5** titles, it is best used in conjunction with my custom fork of SimpleUGC ([UE4 version](https://github.com/randomperson189/UGCExample/tree/release-ue4-custom) and [UE5 version](https://github.com/randomperson189/UGCExample/tree/release-ue5-custom))

Follow the [**Quick Start Guide**](Documentation/QuickStart.md) for a comprehensive look at the Workshop Uploader for instructions to set it up for your own projects.
