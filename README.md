# WorkshopUploader
The **Workshop Uploader** is a custom editor plugin created to facilitate adding Steam Workshop support to **Unreal Engine 4 and 5** titles, it is best used in conjunction with my custom fork of **SimpleUGC** ([UE4 version](https://github.com/randomperson189/UGCExample/tree/release-ue4-custom) and [UE5 version](https://github.com/randomperson189/UGCExample/tree/release-ue5-custom)), requires linking **Epic Games** account to **GitHub** for access.
